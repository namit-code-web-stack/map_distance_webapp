# map_distance_webapp
Map Distance Web App is a responsive full-stack application that calculates the best driving route between two locations using real-time map APIs.
It uses Nominatim API to convert location names into coordinates and OSRM API to determine the shortest route, total distance, and estimated travel time.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses Node.js and Express.
Users can enter any city or place name as source and destination.
The app instantly displays route distance and duration using live data.
It's hosted on Render.com, allowing global access with a single link.
Mobile-first responsive design ensures usability on all devices.
Error handling is built-in for invalid inputs or API failures.
